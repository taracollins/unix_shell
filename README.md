## SYNOPSIS

myshell.py [OPTION] [ARG] [FILE]    

## DESCRIPTION
myshell.py supports a collection of internal commands. If a command is entered in to the command line that is not recognised as an internal command, myshell.py will search the system utilities for the given command and run it as a child process. All arguments and parameters must be seperated by whitespace. This includes a space or a tab. myshell.py may be ran with a batchfile containing commands on the command line. Once all commands in the batchfile have been executed, myshell.py will exit
